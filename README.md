# P2/ASCII PGM (Portable Gray Map) Image Filter
**This repository is for a research project. This repository will eventually be made private when more specific filter code is added.**

*Images scaled down from 512x512 to 300x300.

**About:**

This is an image processing program that uses CUDA. The program includes two methods of processing image data and applying filters:
-	Through normal C++ functions (Host/CPU, Serial Processing)
-	Through Nvidiaâ€™s CUDA kernels (Device/GPU, Parallel Processing)

This program takes in a valid P2 (ASCII Encoded) .PGM file and outputs a new .PGM file with the applied filter of choice. The main image filters featured in this program are the Sobel Operator/Filter and a Blur filter. Options are given to run a filter multiple times on the input image.
.PGM files must have dimensions **no greater than 1024x1024** (arbitrary size limit, I will change this later so that it accepts any arbitrary size).
There are still some weird bugs, but the program now works mostly as I intended it to.

**Purpose:**

The purpose of this project is to act as learning experience and introduce me to programming kernels in CUDA.

**Compiling and Running:**

To compile this project, run make with the command: make

You can also import these project files into Microsoft Visual Studio (or any other IDE that supports CUDA) and compile it from there. Obviously, you must have the CUDA development kit and nvcc compiler installed as well (https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit).

Your computer must also have a CUDA enabled NVIDIA GPU that has a compute compatibility of at least 2.0 in order to compile and/or run this program.

**Loading Valid .PGM Images:**

Image files to be read in are placed in the "Images" sub-folder, and filtered images appear in the "Output" sub-folder with "_output.pgm" appended to their file name.
You can convert other image formats to .PGM with free imaging software such as IrfanView (http://www.irfanview.com/) or GIMP (http://www.gimp.org/). Make sure you select the ASCII encoding option if you want the files to be accepted by this program.

Some of the sample P2 .PGM files used in this project were obtained at: http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/pgma/pgma.html


**Loading Methods:**

To load an image, there are two methods available. The first (enabled by default) has the program ask you to type in the name of the image file. This file must be located in the "Images" subfolder. This first method is internally labeled as manualLoadImage. The second method (CURRENTLY BROKEN) can be enabled by commenting out the call to the manualLoadImage method and uncommenting the line that calls directLoadImage. The program then needs to be recompiled. Once this is done, images are now loaded with this bash syntax: "./filter.out < /path/to/image.pgm" After running this command, the program will automatically load the piped in image file, without giving you a prompt to enter the file name. Both of these methods accomplish the same thing, but the directLoadImage allows you to pipe in image files that are not placed within the Images sub folder. Either way, the final proccessed image is placed into the Output subfolder. There is really no need for this other method, but I wanted to experiment with new ways of loading image data.


**Planned Features and Improvements/Fixes:**

Current Task:
Add the ability to display loaded images from within the program. Using OpenGL, you will be able to display an unfiltered image, run various filters on the image, and see the results displayed in real time from within the program. I will try to make the OpenGL display independent of the CUDA library. This will allow the display method to be modular.

Other Tasks:

Fix the alternate file input method (manualLoadImage).

Remove the arbitrary image size limit. To do this, I will replace the main data array with a vector. I will need to use CUDA specific vectors instead of the C++ STL ones in order for them to be passed to the kernels. http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/thrust/index.html#vectors

As an aside, I will be looking into direct memory access (DMA) for another part of the research project. Implementing DMA with this filter is not what I intend to do, but I might use this program as a testing ground.

Currently, both methods of processing an image (CPU/Serial and GPU/CUDA/Parallel) pass through the image data in a linear fashion. In the future, I will implement a Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) using CUDA's FFT library. This will hopefully increase the CUDA filter performance even more. I might add a FFT method for the CPU/Serial filters, but they would not be using the CUDA FFT library as I want them to only use the CPU. This is done for performance comparison sake (serial vs parallel). This will be done much later, after the fixes and OpenGL stuff is added.
