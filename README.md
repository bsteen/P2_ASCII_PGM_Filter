# P2/ASCII PGM (Portable Gray Map) Image Filter
An image processing program that uses C++ and CUDA. This program includes two methods of processing image data and applying filters:
-	Through C++ functions (Serial Processing)
-	Through Nvidiaâ€™s CUDA kernels (Parallel Processing)

This program takes in a valid P2 (ASCII Encoded) .PGM file and outputs a new .PGM file with the applied filter of choice. The main image filters featured in this program are the Sobel Operator/Filter and a Blur filter.
.PGM files must have dimensions no greater than 1024x1024 (arbitrary limit).

Image files to be read in are placed in the "Images" sub-folder, and filtered images appear in the "Output" sub-folder with "_output.pgm" appended to their file name.
You can convert other image formats to .PGM with free image software such as IrfanView (http://www.irfanview.com/) or GIMP (http://www.gimp.org/). Make sure you select ASCII encoding option.

Some of the sample P2 .PGM files used in this project were obtained at: http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/pgma/pgma.html
